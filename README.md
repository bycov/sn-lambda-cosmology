## 🌌 Abstract

This project presents a radical new cosmological model proposing that the **Big Bang was not a singularity** but the first **gravitational collapse of the universal wavefunction**. We demonstrate through 3D numerical simulations how a quantum fluctuation in a pre-geometric field undergoes gravitational collapse, naturally explaining the origin of time, space, and classical reality.

## 🚀 Key Innovations

- **✓ No Initial Singularity** - smooth transition from quantum superposition
- **✓ Gravity as Objective Observer** - solves quantum measurement problem  
- **✓ Emergent Time & Space** - arise from collapse sequence
- **✓ Natural Explanation of Λ ∼ 10⁻¹²⁰** - from post-collapse vacuum decay
- **✓ Falsifiable Predictions** - CMB anomalies, gravitational decoherence

**Quantitative Results:**
- Initial density: `5.32e-02`
- Peak density after collapse: `2.37e+00`
- **44.6x density increase** in 200 time steps
- Clear phase transition from quantum to classical

## 🧮 Theoretical Framework

### Core Equations
We solve the Schrödinger-Newton system:

```math
i∂ₜψ = -½∇²ψ + Φψ
∇²Φ = 4πG|ψ|²
