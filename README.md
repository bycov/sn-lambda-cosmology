# sn-lambda-cosmology
Theoretical framework and simulations for the Schrödinger-Newton collapse model with dynamic Λ(t) ∝ 1/t³. Resolves cosmological singularities, derives Λ's smallness, and provides testable forecasts for DESI and redshift drift.
# Schrödinger-Newton Cosmology with Dynamic Λ(t)

This repository contains code and materials for our paper on the Schrödinger-Newton collapse model as the origin of dynamic dark energy Λ(t) ∝ 1/t³.
